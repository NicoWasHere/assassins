        <p className = {styles.bigheading}>Rulebook</p>
        <p className = {styles.heading}>Killing:</p>
        <p className = {styles.blurb}>Players are killed by being doused in any amount of pure water by their assassin. After each kill, both the assassin and the target must text at least one Administrator. In the case of any dispute, contact the administrators immediately. Any kill that may fall outside the realm of the rules, or any disagreements about a kill, must be appealed to the administrators who will listen to both sides, discuss the kill and make our decision, which is final and cannot be changed.</p>
        <p className = {styles.heading}>Stunning:</p>
        <p className = {styles.blurb}>If the target hits their assassin first, then the assassin is “stunned” and cannot attack the target for one hour. Only the target can stun their assassin. The stunned participant may still stun in their own defense during this time.</p>
        <p className = {styles.heading}>Cycles:</p>
        <p className = {styles.blurb}>Once the game has begun (April 26th) you will have 7 days to make your first kill and complete your first mission. Each cycle will decrease by one day, so you will have 6 days to make your second kill  and complete your second mission, 5 to make your third kill and complete your third mission, and so on. Kills can be accumulated, so if you kill three people within the first day you do not have to make another kill for the next three cycles. If you fail to keep up with kills, you are disqualified and out of the game. Missions will be assigned at the start of each cycle.</p>
        <p className = {styles.heading}>Missions:</p>
        <p className = {styles.blurb}>This year, because of COVID, you will be assigned a random “mission location” in Lexington at the start of every cycle. You will need to go to this location before the end of the current cycle. You will need to find a specific location and send in a selfie of yourself to prove that you’ve been there. Assassins will be informed of their target’s location, but not when in the day they will be going. This is a way to get people out of the house, and more specific information will be coming on this. 
</p>
        <p className = {styles.heading}>Prizes:</p>
        <p className = {styles.blurb}>The last assassin standing will receive 70% of the entry fees collected. The person with the most kills will receive 15% of the entry fees collected. The rest is taken as a fee for our wonderful services. 
</p>    <p className = {styles.heading}>Additional COVID Regulations:</p>
        <ul className = {styles.blurblist}>
            <li>Players should wear a mask and practice social distancing.</li>
            <li>If you test positive for COVID, you MUST contact the administrators and you are immediately disqualified.</li>
            <li>If you are quarantined due to COVID exposure, you MUST abide by the quarantine. You may get timed out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className = {styles.heading}>Players CANNOT be killed or stunned:</p>
        <ul className = {styles.blurblist}>
            <li>
            On the Lexington High School campus. This is a safe zone at all times (yes, even at 2 am on a Saturday), but other LPS schools are not a safe zone. 
            </li>
            <li>
            On Worthen Rd (up to the skatepark on one side and Capt. Parker Arms on the other side), the J Lot (including Parker St, Clarke St, and Park St) from Monday to Friday from 8am to 1pm.
            </li>
            <li>
            Inside their own homes. Players can be killed if they are inside other people's homes/apartments. However, the assassin MUST be invited into the house. Entering without permission or using physical force to remove them from their home is not allowed, and neither is shooting them through an open door. You may not block someone's driveway to prevent them from accessing their home.

            </li>
            <li>
            While participating in any school sponsored event, including clubs, musicals, and a cappella. This includes people running through town for track, etc. However, you can be killed while going to these events (eg, walking up to someone's house for a cappella practice).

            </li>
            <li>
            En route to school sports games, during organized sports practices or returning back to the locker rooms after school sports (this includes lacrosse from Lincoln Fields to the High School as well as baseball, softball, ultimate frisbee and track if applicable). 

            </li>
            <li>
            In ANY store OR public buildings. 

            </li>
            <li>
            You are safe inside stores within the mall, but not the mall itself.

            </li>
            <li>
            Inside places of worship you are safe if you are attending any organized religious services. However, in the parking lots you are not! **You may not run into any place of worship to escape an assassin; this is disruptive and will result in disqualification. Don’t play at funerals

            </li>
            <li>
            While at work. If you are on shift and need to leave the store to take out trash, go to the bank etc. you will be safe. However, once you clock out of your shift you are no longer safe. 

            </li>
        </ul>

<p className = {styles.heading}>Vehicles:</p>
<ul className={styles.blurblist}>
    <li>You are safe while in or on any transportation vehicle. This includes cars, busses, motorcycles, bicycles, but is not extended to: heelys, rollerblades, scooters, and skateboards (NEW IN 2021). 
</li>
<li>For non-motorized vehicles you have to be in motion to be safe. 
</li>
<li>You cannot stop a transportation vehicle by physical force. 
</li>
<li>
For motorized vehicles, you are safe from an assassin outside of the vehicle as long as the door is closed and your body is fully in the vehicle.

</li>
<li>A car with a door open is fair game, but a car with a window open is not fair game. This is a safety concern: the driver might speed off and hit someone, but is less likely to do so if their door is open. 
</li>
<li>IN A MOVING CAR: you cannot kill, be killed, stun, or be stunned (no matter whether you’re a passenger or especially a driver). 
</li>
<li>This means that drive-by kills and stuns are not allowed. However, kills made from a parked car upon a target outside of the car are allowed.
</li>
<li>You CANNOT ride bikes on LHS campus (that's just a normal LHS rule). 
</li>
<li>
You cannot be killed in a gym, as it’s a public building. 
</li>
</ul>

<p className = {styles.sub}>In the case that someone wishes to contact the administrators, please give them OUR cell phone numbers.
</p>

<p className = {styles.heading}>Weapons:</p>
<p className = {styles.blurb}>You must use pure water to kill your target, if any other form of liquid is used it will not count as a kill. That being said, the means by which you kill them is entirely up to you. Super soakers, hoses, water balloons, cups of water, water bottles (don’t give people COVID), sprinklers etc. are all viable ways to kill a target. 
</p>


<p className = {styles.heading}>In the event of a tie:</p>
<p className = {styles.blurb}>If the target and assassin hit one another at the exact same time, then the assassin is stunned and the target is not eliminated. Both players must agree it was a tie. Any dispute should be taken up with the administrators.
</p>


<p className = {styles.heading}>Protection:</p>
<p className = {styles.blurb}>You may use shields, such as umbrellas, pizza boxes, or trash can lids. Other humans can be used as shields, however anything that can be worn (such as a raincoat or backpack) will not protect you. This means you cannot block a water stream with your rain jacket held in front of you- it is an extension of your body.
</p>

<p className = {styles.heading}>Gentleman’s Kills: </p>
<p className = {styles.blurb}>If you get stressed or bored or just don't want to play anymore, contact the administrators and we will notify your attacker. You will be eliminated but you won't need to time out or be shot with a water gun.
</p>


<p className = {styles.heading}>Elimination:</p>
<p className = {styles.blurb}>Inevitably the majority of you are going to be eliminated, and once you are killed you must give your assassin the name of your target. This becomes their new target. We ask that both players report the elimination as soon as possible so that it can be confirmed by the administrators. If both the target and assassin have agreed on the kill you do not have to wait until elimination is confirmed to make your next kill, but you MUST still tell the administrators ASAP. HOWEVER, if there is a disagreement that needs to be confirmed DO NOT make your next kill until the administrators have confirmed it.

That being said, there is nothing stopping players from forming alliances, bribing targets, and declaring joint victory. This really is a free-for-all.
</p>


<p className  ={styles.sub}>Follow the actual law too. Not following these rules may result in disqualification. All decisions made by Administrators are final, and there are no refunds once the game starts. We are not responsible for your crimes. 
</p>


    <p className = {styles.heading}>Q&A</p>
    <p className = {styles.question}>Q: What does "school campus" consist of? 
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.answer}>A: School campus includes both senior and staff parking lots. Campus is a safe zone at all hours. The smoking corner is not part of campus.
    </p>

    <p className = {styles.question}>Q: Am I safe on my porch or in my garage?
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.answer}>A: You are not safe on your porch as that is not technically inside your house, however you are safe in your garage.
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.question}>Q: Can I bring my weapon to school?
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.answer}>A: No, weapons of any kind are strictly prohibited from Lexington High School. We are not responsible for any trouble you may get in by bringing a weapon to school, and if you are seen with one you will be disqualified.
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.question}>Q: Is there any way to avoid getting killed by my assassin if I am cornered?
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.answer}>A: Yes, If you are smart enough to carry some form of water with you at all times you can stun your attacker by getting them wet, the same way you would kill your target. A stun is only effective if you have not yet been killed, and it lasts for one hour.
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.question}>Q: What if I get overwhelmed and want to stop playing?
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.answer}>A: You can give your assassin a Gentleman's kill, meaning you resign from the game and give them an automatic kill. The target does not have to get water poured on them in this situation to be eliminated, but both parties must notify the administrators of the withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.question}>Q: What other buildings are off limits?
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.answer}>A: Recreation centers in Lexington are safe, including but not limited to Hayden and the Munroe Center. ALL PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN LEXINGTON ARE OFF LIMITS, AND YOU CANNOT ESCAPE INTO A PUBLIC BUILDING.
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.question}>Q: If I get killed and want to get back at my assassin can I tell everyone who their target is?
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.answer}>A: We obviously can't control what you say, but we ask that you respect the other players. Remember, it's just a game.
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.question}>Q: If I live in an apartment building, is the entire building safe or just my unit?
    </p>
    <p className = {styles.answer}>A: The entire building is considered your “home” and is safe at all times.
    </p>

    <p className = {styles.heading}>Good luck, and have fun!</p>
